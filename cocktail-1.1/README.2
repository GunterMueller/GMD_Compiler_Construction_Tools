This bulletin is sent to people that  have  ordered  Cocktail  from  GMD
Karlsruhe,  are using it, or had email interaction with me.  Cocktail is
the Compiler-Compiler Toolbox developed at GMD Karlsruhe.


       This is to announce that professional support for Cocktail
                is now available from its main creator.


What is Cocktail?

Cocktail is the Compiler-Compiler Toolbox developed  at  GMD  Karlsruhe.
The  Cocktail  tools lay emphasis on practical usability and efficiency.
The tools generate compiler parts out of specifications that are as  ef-
ficient as hand-written ones. The use of tools significantly reduces the
construction effort and increases the reliability of the generated  com-
pilers.  The toolbox supports almost all phases of compiler construction
by more or less independent tools that generate C, C++, Modula-2, or (in
part)  Eiffel  source  code.   Cocktail runs on all variants of Unix, as
well as under Linux, MS-DOS and OS/2 and  contains  the  following  main
tools:

   - Rex     scanner generator
   - Lalr    LALR(1) parser generator
   - Ell     LL(1) parser generator
   - Ast     generator for abstract syntax trees
   - Ag      generator for attribute evaluators
   - Puma    transformation of attributed trees using pattern matching



Support for Cocktail

Support for Cocktail is available in two forms: First, users of Cocktail
can be supported with activities such as:

   - Consulting
   - Training
   - Maintenance
   - Updates
   - Development (e. g. new target languages, modified or new tools)
   - Research

Second, application projects using the Cocktail toolbox can  be  carried
out.   This  will  be  projects  which  in  general involve some kind of
language processors such as:

   - Compilers (for standard languages or special purpose languages)
   - Compiler Parts (grammars e. g. for Fortran 90 or Cobol 85,
                Syntax-Analyzers, Front-Ends, Code-Generators)
   - Language Design
   - Source-to-Source Translators (e. g. Modula-2 to C)
   - Dialect Conversion (e. g. DEC-Fortran to ANSI-Fortran)
   - Programming Convention Checkers
   - Software Complexity Measures
     ...



Maintenance

Software maintenance includes new releases of the software, new versions
of  the documentation, description of updates, and processing of written
trouble reports or suggestions over a period of 12 months. I will  reply
to  written reports with a written response and correct reproducible er-
rors within a reasonable time.  On request, hot-line service can be  of-
fered.


Legal Status

Cocktail has been developed during the last years at the Karlsruhe  sub-
sidiary  of  GMD - the German National Research Center for Computer Sci-
ence.  Although Cocktail was supplied in  the  past  with  the  complete
source code, it is copyrighted software, not public domain.  Cocktail as
well as its output could be used for  any  purpose,  whether  education,
research,  or  commercial  application.  The Cocktail toolbox was unsup-
ported software - without warranty  and  maintenance.   GMD  assumed  no
responsibility for the use or reliability of its software.  All versions
of Cocktail up to Version 9309 can still be used under these  conditions
- as unsupported software.

Now Cocktail will be professionally supported by its main creator.   Fu-
ture versions of Cocktail will be distributed under a license agreement.
There will be two kinds of license agreements:  The  commercial  license
allows  the  use  of Cocktail and of its output for any purpose, whether
education, research, or commercial application.   The  research  license
allows  the  use  of  Cocktail and of its output only for non-commercial
usage such as education and research.  The licenses  allow  the  use  of
Cocktail  on  any platform and from any number of users within one site.
Maintenance is available for Cocktail from Version 9311.


Products

The table below lists the available software.  The  Cocktail  tools  are
available  either  as  single  tools or as the complete toolbox. Several
tools come with support programs: For example the scanner generator  rex
is  distributed  with  the programs rpp, l2r, and r2l. The library reuse
and the collection of scanner and parser specifications "specs"  is  au-
tomatically  included with every tool.  The tools are distributed in the
form of obfuscated C sources thus guaranteeing portability over  a  wide
range  of  platforms.   The  software  is supplied with documentation in
machine-readable formats: Postscript, troff, or ASCII. On request, docu-
mentation can be supplied on paper.

New Features

With respect to Version 9209 the next release of Cocktail (Version 9311)
will have the following new features:

- The tools rex, lalr, and ell do not generate table files any more  for
  the target language Modula-2. Instead, an initialization code based on
  compressed strings is used. Consequently, all tools do not need  table
  files  any more and the problem whether these files are configured for
  little-endian  or  big-endian  machines  is  eliminated.  The   target
  'bin.conv' has been removed from all Makefiles.

- The tools rex and lalr  can  generate  scanners  and  parsers  in  the
  language Eiffel.

- A restriction in the size of the grammars processed by lalr  has  been
  removed allowing the generation of parsers for really huge grammars.

- Lark is a complete  new  implementation  of  a  parser  generator  for
  LALR(1)  and  LR(1)  grammars. It is compatible with lalr and will re-
  place lalr in the future. It features:
  + processes LALR(1) and LR(1) grammars
  + fast generation of information about LR-conflicts
  + trace of parsing steps during run-time available
  + supports named attributes as well as the $i notation
  + semantic predicates control parsing by conditions
  + support for backtracking parsing
  + includes bnf - no preprocessing necessary

-  As  a  first  step  to  list-processing  ast  generates  a  procedure
  ForallTREE  that  allows to perform an operation for all elements of a
  list.

- Besides evaluators based on recursive procedures, ag can now  generate
  evaluators  based  on  a stack automaton. This results in a tremendous
  reduction of the stack consumption. The recursive evaluators  are  now
  optimized with elimination of tail recursion.

- The code generated by puma is optimized with elimination of  tail  re-
  cursion, too.

- Two versions of the Modula-2 to C Translator are available. One  prob-
  lem  in translating Modula-2 to C is that nested procedure definitions
  have to be transformed into unnested procedures and that  a  mechanism
  to access intermediate-level variables is necessary. mtc-1 uses global
  pointers to access intermediate-level variables. This does  not  allow
  the  use  of  coroutines. mtc-2 uses static links and introduces addi-
  tional procedure parameters and thus allows the use of coroutines.

Further Information

GMD  will  be  closing  its   Karlsruhe   subsidiary   (Forschungsstelle
Karlsruhe)  by  the  end  of the year 1993. This is one reason for me to
found a company and continue the work on Cocktail on a commercial basis.
Moreover,  I might lose e-mail access at the end of this year - at least
my business address will change.
