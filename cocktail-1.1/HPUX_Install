File Changes:

->	Changed installation paths in top level makefile.
->	Changed the cmd-line for the install prog in EVERY (*used*) subdir Makefile.

To Build:

->	change paths in top-level Makefile to reflect your system.
->	type 'make install'.
->  go and have a nice cup of tea...

To Test:

->	Hmm... See README file in top level directory for an overview of what
    these progs do.
