A Simple Test of Rex
====================

Currently (Sept. 1988) Rex has been tested successfully for its 2 target
languages using 2 different Modula-2 compilers:

test | language | compiler
----------------------------------
C    | C        | cc
MC   | Modula   | MOCKA (mc)
M2C  | Modula   | SUN Modula (m2c)

To run a test use:

   make <test> MLIB=...

where MLIB (=reuse) is the directory containing the Modula library.
