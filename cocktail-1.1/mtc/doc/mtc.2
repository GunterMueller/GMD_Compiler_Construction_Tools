NAME
     mtc - Modula-2 to C Translator

SYNOPSIS
     mtc [ options ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
     Mtc translates Modula-2 programs into readable C code.   Mtc
     implements  the  language  Modula-2 as defined in N. Wirth's
     report (3rd edition) with  a  few  minor  restrictions  (see
     below)  and  most  language extensions implemented by MOCKA,
     the Modula-2 Compiler Karlsruhe. It produces K&R (not  ANSI)
     C code with a few very common extensions like passing struc-
     tures as value parameters.
     A definition or foreign module module.md is translated  into
     a  C  header  file  module.h.  An  implementation or program
     module module.mi is  translated  into  the  corresponding  C
     source  file  module.c.   Separate compilation is handled by
     reprocessing all transitively  imported  definition  modules
     when  translating a compilation unit. If file is omitted mtc
     reads from standard input.
     Mtc is intended as a tool for translating finished  programs
     from  Modula-2  to  C and not as a tool for program develop-
     ment.  Therefore, the translator does not check the semantic
     correctness of the Modula-2 programs.
     For each  foreign  module  an  empty  implementation  module
     corresponding  to  it has to be translated to C, because the
     initialization routine produced for the dummy implementation
     module  is  used  within  the modules resp. C programs which
     import the foreign module.
     If the library function alloca is available and the  C  pro-
     grams  are  compiled  with  the  flag -DStackAlloc, then the
     memory space for open array value parameters will  be  allo-
     cated  in  the  stack  frame of the corresponding procedure.
     This temporary space will be freed  automatically  when  the
     procedure  returns.  Otherwise, malloc and free will be used
     to allocate and deallocate memory space for open array value
     parameters.

     SYSTEM_.h   Definition of standard constants,  types,  func-
                 tions,  and  macros,  which are used in the gen-
                 erated C programs.

DIAGNOSTICS
     The translator reports lexical and syntactic errors,  errors
     detected  during  the  handling of separate compilation, and
     restrictions of the code generation.   The  translator  does
     not check the semantic correctness of the Modula-2 programs.
     The diagnostics produced by mtc are  intended  to  be  self-
     explanatory.

BUGS
     Coroutines are not supported.
     Forward references within pointer declarations  are  limited
     to structured types.
     Comments are not translated from Modula-2 to C.
     In some very rare cases the translator has to evaluate  con-
     stant expressions, because a literal translation is not pos-
     sible. The translator will fail to do this, if  the  expres-
     sion   or   one   of  its  operands  is  not  in  the  range
     MIN(INTEGER)..MAX(INTEGER).
