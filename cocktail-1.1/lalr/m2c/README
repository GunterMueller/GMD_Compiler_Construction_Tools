Lalr - Parser Generator
======================

The common front-end (front) for bnf, ell, and lalr must have been compiled
before you can generate lalr. As lalr makes use of the library of reusable
Modula-2 modules (MLIB=reuse), this library must also have been compiled before.
It has been compiled successfully on several configurations:

configuration | computer | processor | operating-system | compiler
--------------------------------------------------------------------
CC            | SUN 3    | MC 68020  | SunOS 4.1        | cc
CC	      | SUN 4    | SPARC     | SunOS 4.1  	| cc
CC	      | VAX 2000 |	     | ULTRIX V2.0	| cc

CC	      | DEC 3100 | MIPS      | ULTRIX V2.0-7	| cc

To generate lalr use:

   make install BIN=... LIB=... OPT=...
